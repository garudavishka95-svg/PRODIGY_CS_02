**Prodigy Infotech - Cybersecurity Internship**  
**Task 2: Password Strength Checker**

---

## 📌 Description
This project is a command-line based Python tool that checks the **strength of a password** based on key security criteria. It provides feedback and suggestions to help users create more secure passwords.

### ✔️ Features
- Checks for:
  - Minimum length of 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one digit
  - At least one special character
- Rates password strength as:
  - Very Weak ❌
  - Weak ❗
  - Moderate ⚠️
  - Strong ✅
  - Very Strong 💪
- Gives real-time improvement suggestions

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (`re` module)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3+).
2. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python password_strength_checker.py

## 💻 Example Output

```
Enter your password to check strength: Abc123
Password Strength: Moderate ⚠️
Suggestions to improve:
• Password should be at least 8 characters long.
• Include a special character (e.g., !, @, #, etc.).
```
